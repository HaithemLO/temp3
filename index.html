      TASK A
      INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF YOUR SYSTEM AND EXTRACT AN
      APPROXIMATE FIRST ORDER TRANSFER FUNCTION MODEL WITH
      DELAY. CLEARLY DISCUSS AND JUSTIFY THE PROCEDURES YOU
      FOLLOW AS WELL AS ALL YOUR FINDINGS.
      The two manipulated variables, which are present within the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit
      (FCCU), that provide an input to the system are Fs (the catalyst recycle rate) and Fa (rate of
      regenerator air). There are also three measured variables: the regenerator’s gas cyclone
      temperature (Tcy), the regenerator bed temperature (Trg) and the riser outlet temperature (T1).
      In order to develop the dynamic model for a system, the following procedure is followed:
      1. Identify input and output variables.
      2. Select an input variable and introduce a step change.
      3. Select and output variable and trace its response.
      4. Develop a first order model, with delay, to approximate the response.
      Firstly, it was necessary to induce a step change in the regenerator air rate, in order to produce
      a 1st order transfer function from the FCCU system. Prior to a step change, the output Tcy at
      steady state is showing in Figure 1a; however, after a step change of 1 is introduced at time
      zero (from 25.35 kg s-1 to 26.35 kg s-1), the resulting output is highlighted in Figure 1b.
      Figure 1a – Tcy at steady state.
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      3
      Figure 1b - Tcy with a step change of 1 K.
      Firstly, it is apparent that the system reaches steady state after the step change at approximately
      120 s, attaining a maximum value of 999.0 K. As well as this, there is a significant degree of
      fluctuation within Figure 1b, due to the noise within the system; and therefore, the first order
      approximated transfer function will have a degree of error associated to it.
      In order to approximate the first order transfer function, the below derivation must be
      transferred into Laplace time. Equation 1 is the first order differential, modelling the output in
      the time domain, with y representing the output and f(t) representing the input. Kp and 𝜏
      representing the steady state gain and the process time constant respectively (both being
      characteristic of the system at hand).
      𝜏
      𝑑𝑦
      𝑑𝑡 + 𝑦 = 𝐾𝑝𝑓(𝑡) (1)
      Equation 2 shows the conversion of the variables to deviation variables, a necessary step prior
      to conversion to Laplace time. y’ represents the process output and output its deviation from
      steady state. The same principle is equally applied to input, f(t).
      𝜏
      𝑑𝑦′
      𝑑𝑡 + 𝑦
      ′ = 𝐾𝑝𝑓′(𝑡) (2)
      Between Equation 2 and 3, there has been a transfer to Laplace time.
      𝜏𝑠𝑦̃(𝑠) + 𝑦̃(𝑠) = 𝐾𝑝𝑓′(𝑠) (3)
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      4
      Equation 4 is a re-arrangement of Equation 3, in terms of output divided by input – the
      definition of the transfer function.
      𝐺(𝑠) =
      𝑦̃(𝑠)
      𝑓̃(𝑠)
      =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑠 + 1
      (4)
      The transfer function can be better approximated accounting for the time delay, which is
      defined in Equation 5.
      𝐺(𝑠) =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑠 + 1
      𝑒
      −𝑡𝑑𝑠
      (5)
      There are two methods available in which the delay can be calculated, one graphically, and the
      other is through calculating back after determining the gradient. However, before this occurs,
      the value for Kp can be found. Figure 2 highlights the change in output; necessary to determine
      the Kp, with the definition outlined by Equation 6.
      Figure 2 - Tcy with a step change of 1 K with measured output change.
      𝐾𝑝 =
      ∆ (𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡)𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑦 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒
      ∆ (𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡) 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑦 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 (6)
      Having changed the output for a step change of 1, Kp can be calculated, shown in Equation 7.
      Using the Simulink software, the output value was determined through measurement at times
      0 (at steady state, prior to the step) and 650 s (at steady state after the step) to calculate the
      change in output.
      𝐾𝑝 =
      999.0 − 988.2

      The graphical method is depicted in Figure 3, with points chosen to calculate the initial
      gradient of the approximated first order curve. This would allow extrapolation back to the yaxis origin to determine the time delay. The values chosen are illustrated within the figure.
      Figure 3 – Method to obtain the time delay of the system.
      Therefore, the gradient is calculated using the points (10.185, 988.70) and (11.829, 989.70).
      This is shown in Equation 8. However, after shifting the curve by 988.2 (the temperature at
      time 0), the points are (10.185, 0.500) and (11.829, 1.500).
      𝑚 =
      1.500 − 0.500
      11.829 − 10.185 = 0.608 (8)
      At the point (10.185, 0.500), and using the previously calculated gradient, the y-intercept can
      be determined as 𝑐 = −5.692. Equation 9 and 10 are then used to determine the time delay,
      when 𝑦 = 0.
      𝑦 = 0.608𝑥 − 5.692 (9)
      𝑥 = 𝑡𝑑 =
      5.692
      0.608
      = 9.363 𝑠 (10)
      When comparing this to the result determined graphically, in which a value of 9.615 s was
      determined, there is a minimal difference of 0.252 s; however, carrying forward, the previous
      value listed in Equation 10 will be used.
      After this, the value of the process time constant 𝜏𝑝 must be determined, through finding the
      time that is required for the system to reach 63.2 % of the new steady state, minus the time 
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      6
      delay td. The corresponding temperature of the system at T63.2% was found to be 995.026 K and
      is shown in Equation 11.
      𝑇63.2% = 998.2 𝐾 + 0.632(999.0 − 988.2)𝐾 = 995.026 K (11)
      Using this value, the time at which the temperature of 995.026 K is achieved can be determined
      graphically. The value is found to be 27.600 s; however, there is a degree of error in reading
      this value, due to the noise present within the system. Following this the process time constant
      𝜏𝑝 is calculated as previously described and shown in Equation 12 and 13.
      𝜏𝑝 = 𝑡63.2% − 𝑡𝑑 (12)
      𝜏𝑝 = 27.600𝑠 − 9.363𝑠 = 18.237𝑠 (13)
      The time delay is due to a lag effect within the system, in which the gas cyclone temperature
      does not increase, with increasing regenerator air rate, thereby proving the existence of dead
      time.
      Using the calculated values, the approximated transfer function can then be found through
      implementation of Equation 5. Therefore, the final approximated first order transfer function
      is defined in Equation 14.
      𝐺(𝑠) =
      10.8
      18.237𝑠 + 1
      𝑒
      −9.363𝑠
      (14)
      Figure 4 shows this approximated transfer function in comparison to the actual system
      dynamics curve. Figure 4 highlights that the calculated transfer function is a representative
      approximation of the actual system dynamics.

      TASK B
      DEMONSTRATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE APPROXIMATE MODEL YOU
      OBTAINED IN (A) ILLUSTRATING THAT IT WORKS FOR A RANGE OF
      DIFFERENT (NOT ONLY STEP) INPUTS. CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE, DISCUSS
      AND JUSTIFY ALL YOUR FINDINGS.
      The definition of the robustness of the approximated model is its ability to cope with
      disturbances or varying system parameters (Smith, 1995). To test the robustness of the
      approximated model obtained in part (A) various inputs were connected to the step, these
      include; the sine function, pulse generator function, uniform random number function and the
      ramp function. The robustness of the approximated model will be verified through the addition
      of each of these inputs whilst monitoring the output, evaluating the similarity of the
      approximated model against that of the actual system dynamics. Figure 5 depicts the addition
      of these inputs, with each added separately as in individual investigation.
      Figure 5 – Simulink model used to induce different input functions.

      SINE FUNCTION
      A sinusoidal wave is produced when implementing the sine function to the system. The
      amplitude for the test was set at a value of 1, as well as the frequency at 1 rad s-1. The bias,
      phase and sample time were kept at a value of 0. This ensures that the block is operating in a
      continuous mode. Studying Figure 6, it shows that the approximate model is a good
      approximation to the system dynamics.
      Figure 6 – Real and approximated model showing change to Tcy with time inputting sine function.
      RAMP FUNCTION
      Secondly, a test was conducted to see the robustness of the approximated model using the ramp
      input. A ramp of 0.5 was set, with a start time of 0 and an initial output of 0 also. The results
      from this test can be seen in Figure 7. The model can be seen as a good approximation within
      the range of 0 to 55 s; however, beyond this, there is a significant degree of deviation between
      the approximated model and the system dynamics, with the approximated model showing a
      linear increasing rate of overshoot.
      Figure 7 – Real and approximated model showing change to Tcy with time inputting ramp function.
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      9
      PULSE GENERATOR FUNCTION
      A test was also conducted using the pulse generator function using an amplitude of 0.5, with a
      set period of 10 s; a pulse width of 5%; and a time delay of 0 s. Figure 8 highlights the results
      of this, with the output of the model generating continuous waves. Despite the fluctuation
      around the model, it can be considered to be a good approximation.
      Figure 8 – Real and approximated model showing change to Tcy with time inputting pulse generator function.
      UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBER FUNCTION
      The uniform random number input provides a randomly uniformly distributed output signal,
      with the output being repeatable for a given seed. The conditions set were a minimum and
      maximum of -1 and 1 respectively, with a sample time of 0.5 s and a seed of 0. The model is
      seen to be robust, as the system dynamics do not deviate from the approximated model. This
      is highlighted in Figure 9.
      Figure 9 – Real and approximated model showing change to Tcy with time inputting random number function.

      TASK C
      DESIGN STABLE CONTROLLERS BASED ON YOUR APPROXIMATE
      SYSTEM USING DIFFERENT TUNING METHODOLOGIES (YOU WILL
      HAVE TO CONSULT THE LITERATURE FOR PART OF THIS TASK).
      ZIEGLER-NICHOLS METHOD (PI & PID)
      The Ziegler-Nichols tuning method is one of the oldest and most used methods for PID
      parameter tuning, with methods being available for closed and open loop control (Amit and
      Garg, 2015). Table 1 defines the Ziegler-Nichols tuning parameters (Noris, 2006).

      However, these values must be manipulated prior to inputting into Simulink. This is
      described by the following Equations 15-17, with the results displayed in Table 2.

      11
      Using the Ziegler-Nichols PI and PID results and inputting this to Simulink for a step change
      in the output Tcy from 988.1 K to 999.0 K for the real system, is highlighted in Figure 10. A
      filter value of 1 is set for the PID controller. This is due to large values of N, this will ensure
      that there is an ideal derivate term; however, an ideal derivative has a high gain, meaning noise
      will generate large fluctuations in the control signal. To ensure this does not occur, N is set to
      a low value chosen in this work to be 1.
      Figure 10 – Ziegler-Nichols PI and PID controllers for a step change from 988.1 K to 999.0 K for the
      approximate system.
      Figure 10 highlights the effect of both the PI (blue) and PID (red) controllers, as well as
      referencing the set-point (yellow). Both controllers are seen to have overshot the set-point of
      999.0 K, prior oscillating around the value. Each oscillation, as time progresses, diminishes in
      amplitude, until reaching steady state. It must be noted that there is still an element of white
      noise affecting the system; therefore, reducing the ability of the controller to maintain an output
      of 999.0 K after the step change.
      For the PID controller, the system initially overshoots to an output value of 1007.0 K at
      approximately 27 s; however, it responds quicker to the step change in comparison to the PI
      controller, which only experiences an overshoot to the value of 1001.0 K at approximately 30
      s. The time as to which both the PID and PI controller reached steady state were approximately
      170 s and 140 s respectively.
      In order to check the stability of the controllers, both were subjected to step changes of 1K,
      2K, 5K, 10K and 20K. The results can be seen in Figures 11-12. With both controllers, as the
      step change is increased, the overshoot of the set point also increases. Comparing the PI and
      PID controllers it can be seen that the PID controller overshoots to a greater degree and also
      experience a longer period of oscillations about the set point in comparison to the PI controllers,
      with the PI controllers reaching steady state in a shorter amount of time.
      In addition to this, further investigation was required to be carried out on the PID controller
      with regards to the filter coefficient, N, that can be varied. It was prudent to carry out multiple 
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      12
      simulations across a range of filter coefficient values to see if this effect corresponds with the
      previously mentioned hypothesis regarding the differential aspect of the controller. Values of
      N=1, 10 and 100 were chosen to be investigated. Figures 12-14 display the results of said
      simulations.
      Figure 11 – Ziegler-Nichols PI controller with step changes of +1 K, +2 K, +5 K, +10 K and +20 K.

      Figure 14 – Ziegler-Nichols PID controller with step changes of +1 K, +2 K, +5 K, +10 K, + 20K and N=100.
      As the filter coefficient is increased, the following changes are identified:
      • The amplitude of the oscillations dramatically increases about the set point.
      • The number of oscillations increases with a simultaneous decrease in wavelength.
      The changes displayed and identified highlight the effect that changing the filter value, N, has
      on the system, with lower N values resulting in greater stability of the system due to the
      decreased number and amplitude of oscillations; therefore, proving the aforementioned
      predictions.

      14
      COHEN-COON METHOD (PI & PID)
      Similar to Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon developed a tuning method which is considered more
      complex but there is a difference in the fact that the Cohen-Coon method provides a controller
      with a faster rise time (Amit and Garg, 2015).
      The values obtained during part A, are those described in Table 3.

      These values were then inputted into Simulink in order to carry out analysis and comparisons
      of the controller’s effect on the real system. The flowsheet of the Cohen-Coon model can be
      seen in Figure 15.

      Figure 15 – Cohen-Coon Simulink flowsheet.
      Figure 16 highlights the comparison between the PI and PID controllers, after using the CohenCoon model. A step change from 988.1 K to 999.0 K was tested, similar to what was previously
      conducted for the Ziegler-Nicholas model. The figure highlights the greatest overshoot is for
      the PID controller, achieving a value of 1009.0 K, with the PI controller only achieving a peak
      overshoot of 1005.0 K. In addition to this, the PI controller converges at the steady state setpoint at a time of approximately 151 s; however, the PID controller achieves steady state at
      approximately 200 s. Due to the reduced amplitude and oscillation around the set point, as well
      as achieving steady state faster, the PI controller is presumed to be the optimal controller for
      the Cohen-Coon model in comparison to the PID controller. This is a similar result to that
      achieved after modelling from the Ziegler-Nicholas model; however, this will be discussed in
      further detail later.

      Secondly a test was conducted to see the response of the PI and PID controllers with varying
      step changes of 1 K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K and 20 K. This is depicted in Figures 17-18. It can be seen
      that for both controllers, there is a subsequent increase in the overshoot with increasing step
      change, with the largest overshoot for both controllers being exhibited in the 20 K step change.
      As well as this, a longer time is required in order for the system operating with a PID controller
      to achieve the steady state output for all step changes.
      In conjunction with this, a test was conducted to understand the effect of the filter coefficient
      on the response of the system output, for the PID controller. N was set as 1, 10 and 100 (similar
      to the test conducted for the Ziegler-Nicholas method), with the noise within the system being
      accounted for by the film coefficient. The results for this are highlighted by Figures 18-20.
      Similarly, to the previous test for increasing the filter coefficient, it can be seen that the
      oscillations decrease in wavelength and increase in amplitude; and therefore, this reduces the
      stability of the system when using a PID controller, reaffirming the trend seen for ZieglerNichols and in theory.

      INTERNAL MODEL CONTROL WITH DELAY APPROXIMATED BY 1 S T ORDER TAYLOR EXPANSION
      Internal Model Control (IMC) is an amalgamation of a controller and of a simulation of a
      process, the internal model. The internal model allows the computation of the difference
      between the process output and of the internal model (Zhang, 2010). Using an internal model,
      based on the process model, it is theoretically possible to attain perfect control of the system
      (Mokhatab and Poe, 2012).
      The delay for the process within the transfer function has previously been defined as an
      exponential, highlighted in Equation 28.
      𝐺𝑝
      (𝑠) = 𝐺̃𝑝
      (𝑠) =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      𝑒
      −𝑡𝑑𝑠
      (28)
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      19
      However, using 1st order Taylor expansion, the delay can be approximated as described in
      Equation xx. This is necessary in order to linearise the expression, allowing for the formation
      of an IMC.
      𝑒
      −𝑡𝑑𝑠 ≈ 1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠 (29)
      Therefore, the transfer function can be represented as:
      𝐺𝑝
      (𝑠) = 𝐺̃𝑝
      (𝑠) =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      (1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠) (30)
      In order to develop the IMC with perfect representation, the inverse of the process transfer
      function is developed, as highlighted by Equation 31.
      𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) =
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      𝐾𝑝(1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠)
      (31)
      The denominator now contains one pole, which can be considered unstable. This is due to
      the controller transfer function containing a positive, real pole; and therefore, this part must
      be removed.
      However, when removing this, the transfer function is no longer physically realisable, as the
      order of the denominator is less than that of the numerator. In order for the controller to be
      semi-proper, or proper, the denominator must be of equal or greater order than that of the
      numerator. In order to solve this problem, a filter is added, ensuring the model is now
      considered semi-proper. This is shown in Equation 32, with 𝜆 representing the filter tuning
      parameter.
      𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) =
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (32)
      Finally, the expression for 𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) can be represented by Equation 33, leading to substitution
      and re-arrangement to achieve the controllers transfer function.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      𝐺𝑞
      1 − 𝐺𝑞𝐺̃𝑝
      (33)
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      1 −
      𝐾𝑝(1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠)
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      1 −
      (1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (34)
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      20
      Equation 34 shows the substitution of both 𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) and 𝐺̃𝑝(𝑠) into Equation 33. The
      denominator of Equation 34 then needs to be homogenised to simplify the transfer function
      further.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      −
      (1 − 𝑡𝑑𝑠)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝(𝜆𝑠 + 𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1 − 1)
      (35)
      Therefore 𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) can finally be represented as:
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      𝜏𝑝𝑠
      𝐾𝑝𝑠(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)
      +
      1
      𝐾𝑝𝑠(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)
      (36)
      The transfer function for the controller is shown in two distinct parts, with the first
      representing the proportional aspect of the controller, and the second representing the
      integral. Using this, 𝐾𝑐 can be determined, as shown in Equation 37.
      𝐾𝑐 =
      𝜏𝑝
      𝐾𝑝(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)
      (37)
      Subsequently, 𝜏𝑖 can be calculated through re-arranging Equation 38, as depicted in Equation
      39.
      𝐾𝑐
      𝜏𝑖𝑠
      =
      𝜏𝑝
      𝐾𝑝(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)𝑠
      (38)
      𝜏𝑖 = 𝐾𝑐𝐾𝑝(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑) (39)
      With the value of 𝜏𝑖
      , 𝜆 and 𝐾𝑐 all being unknown, the substitution of Equation 37 is needed
      into Equation 38 in order to remove 𝜆. This is represented by Equation 40.
      𝜏𝑖 =
      𝜏𝑝𝐾𝑝(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)
      𝐾𝑝(𝜆 + 𝑡𝑑)
      = 𝜏𝑝 (40)
      With 𝐾𝑐 equal to the proportional aspect, and Equation 41 equal to the integral aspect,
      neither can be calculated without first determining the optimum value for 𝜆.
      𝐼 =
      𝐾𝑐
      𝜏𝑖

      Table 6 – IMC (delay approximated by Taylor) tuning parameters and Simulink coefficients.
      Table 6 shows the three values for 𝜆 that were considered (5, 10, 15) and the proportional
      and integral controller parameters were calculated and set within Simulink, to achieve a setpoint of 999.0 K. These values were selected because, for an ideal controller, the value of 𝜆
      must be less than the process time for the controller to respond quicker. The results obtained
      for each of these 𝜆 values is depicted in Figure 21. For a 𝜆 value of 5, the system overshoots
      the desired set-point, whilst the response for a 𝜆 of 15 can be considered overdamped.
      Despite still having a small overshoot, the 𝜆 of 10 can be considered the optimum and will be
      considered for the remainder of this section.
      Figure 21 – IMC (delay approximated by Taylor) with filter coefficient values, N, of 5, 10 and 15.
      After determining the value of 𝜆, consideration into the effectiveness of using the IMC model
      can be conducted. Firstly, the flowsheet described in Figure 22 was set prior to analysis.

      K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K and 20 K. As the step change is increased, the overshoot of the systems output
      also increases.

      INTERNAL MODEL CONTROL WITH DELAY APPROXIMATED BY PADE
      The perfect controller is mathematically attainable through design based upon the inverse of
      the process; however, perfect control is unattainable in practicable applications due to
      constraints that will be outlined below.
      The process transfer function is described by Equation 42.
      𝐺𝑝
      (𝑠) = 𝐺̃𝑝
      (𝑠) =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      𝑒
      −𝑡𝑑𝑠
      (42)
      Where the delay of the process is represented by the exponential term. In order to simplify this
      exponential factor, the Pade approximation may be used, shown by Equation 43.
      𝑒
      −𝑡𝑑𝑠 ≈
      −0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1
      0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1
      (43)
      Substituting this value into Equation 44, the process transfer function becomes:
      𝐺𝑝
      (𝑠) = 𝐺̃𝑝
      (𝑠) =
      𝐾𝑝
      𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1
      −0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1
      0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1
      (44)
      As described a perfect controller could be produced in theory through use of the inverse of the
      process.
      𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) =
      1
      𝐺̃𝑝
      (𝑠)
      =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝(−0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      (45)
      The first constraint is highlighted above, with a positive pole being present in the denominator.
      The presence of just one positive pole leads to a destabilised system and, therefore, action must
      be taken. As the designer of the controller, it is within our power to remove this positive pole
      from the equation entirely. This is provided that the remaining equation has a denominator
      polynomial in the controller, of which the order is higher than or equal to that of the numerator.
      The method of enabling this to be the case is through the addition of one or multiple filters
      depending on the process, as shown in Equation, into the controller. The filter tuning parameter
      is given as 𝜆 and is described in Equation 46.
      𝑓(𝑠) =
      1
      𝜆𝑠 + 1
      (46)
      Analysing Equation 45, it is seen that the numerator is second order and the denominator,
      following the removal of the positive pole, is zero order. Therefore, to make the denominator 
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      24
      at least of equal order, two filters must be added. The resultant controller is shown in Equation
      47.
      𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (47)
      Finally, the equation for the controller transfer function is given in Equation 48.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      𝐺𝑞
      1 − 𝐺̃𝑝𝐺𝑞
      (48)
      Substituting the previously derived equations for 𝐺𝑝
      (𝑠) and 𝐺𝑞
      (𝑠) into Equation 48 yields
      Equation 49.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      1 −
      𝐾𝑝

      .
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (49)
      Homogenising the denominator produces Equation 50.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1) − (0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      (𝜆𝑠 + 1)(𝜆𝑠 + 1)
      =
      (𝜏𝑝𝑠 + 1)(0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 + 1)
      𝐾𝑝(𝜆
      2𝑠
      2 + 2𝜆𝑠 + 1 + 0.5𝑡𝑑𝑠 − 1)
      (50)
      Simplifying Equation 50 and expanding the bracket leads to Equation 51.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      0.5𝑡𝑑𝜏𝑝𝑠
      2 + (𝜏𝑝 + 0.5𝑡𝑑)𝑠 + 1
      𝐾𝑝
      (𝜆
      2𝑠 + 2𝜆 + 0.5𝑡𝑑
      )𝑠
      (51)
      Finally, the controller transfer function can be represented by Equation 52.
      𝐺𝑐
      (𝑠) =
      0.5𝑡𝑑𝜏𝑝𝑠
      2 + (𝜏𝑝 + 0.5𝑡𝑑)𝑠 + 1

      From Equation 52 the expressions 𝐾𝑐
      , 𝜏𝐼 and 𝜏𝐷 can be obtained. This is done through the

      It can be seen that each of these functions depend upon the filter tuning parameter, 𝜆, which is
      currently unknown. Therefore, several values of 𝜆 were inputted into Equation 53 and
      Equations 61-63 and across various simulations, with the results analysed to determine the
      correct value of 𝜆. Again, these values of 𝜆 were chosen to be less than the process time for
      the reasons aforementioned. Table 7 shows the values inputted into Simulink when varying
      the 𝜆 value, with Figure 24 denoting the system output response for each controller with a
      varying 𝜆 value and a constant filter coefficient of 1. For a 𝜆 of 5, the response is seen to be
      underdamped, with a quicker initial response but with a degree of overshoot. There is also a
      degree of oscillation, prior to reaching steady state, a distinct feature of an underdamped
      system. Therefore, the optimal 𝜆 value is seen to be a value of 10, reaching steady state faster
      than that for a value of 15, as well as attaining no overshoot. Consequently a 𝜆 value of 10 was
      used for the remainder of the analysis of the IMC (Pade) controller.

      Similar to the studies conducted previously, the system response for a system including an
      IMC controller with delay approximated by Pade, was tested for different step changes,
      ranging from 1 K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K and 20 K. This is depicted in Figures 25a, Figures 25b and
      Figures 25c, showing the change in response for varying filter values: 1, 10 and 100.
      Firstly, it can be seen that as the step change is increased, there is little difference in the
      response of the system prior to achieving steady state after the step change, with the time
      taken to achieve steady state remaining approximately constant, as well as seeing little to no
      oscillation in the system response for the IMC controller.
      Secondly, as the filter coefficient, N is increased from 1 to 100, there is also little change in
      response, with only the larger step changes seeing some degree of oscillation prior to
      achieving steady state; however, there is no overshoot of the set-point for this IMC controller.

      SUMMARY
      In conclusion, Figure 26 shows the system response for each of the four methods used for a
      step change from 998.1 K to 999.0 K at t=0, with the best controller chosen for both the
      Cohen-Coon and Ziegler-Nichols methods (PI Controllers). For the PID controller described for
      the IMC Pade method, a filter coefficient of 1 was used, despite the result varying minimally
      when the filter coefficient was changed between 1 and 100. It can be seen from Figure 26,
      that both the Ziegler- Nichols and Cohen-Coon methods have the largest overshoots, with
      both appearing to possess the largest degree of oscillation around the set-point as well.
      Choosing between these two controllers, it is apparent that the Ziegler-Nichols PI controller
      is the best, due to it possessing an overshoot approximately 4 K lesser than the Cohen-Coon
      PI controller, as well as achieving steady state after less time.
      However, neither of these controllers compare to the two IMC controllers. Despite the IMC
      Taylor PI controller showing some degree of overshoot, it is significantly less than that for the
      Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon PI controllers. When comparing the two IMC methods, it can
      be seen that the Pade controller is the optimal, as despite both achieving steady state at
      approximately the same time, the Pade controller possesses no overshoot.

      TASK D
      EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHICH UNITS OF YOUR BLOCK USE DEVIATION VARIABLES AS INPUTS AND
      OUTPUTS AND WHICH REAL VARIABLES, BY USING APPROPRIATE DIAGRAMS.
      Within a process, values fluctuate about a set-point value across a period of time. In order to
      ensure that the set-point is maintained, it must be guaranteed that the fluctuations about the setpoint are compensated and accounted for. It requires less computation to calculate the change
      required to maintain the set-point rather than tracking the total value of the variable. Therefore,
      during control of systems, it is typical to convert variables to deviation variables (also referred
      to as perturbation variables), observing the difference between the current actual value and that
      of the steady state set point value. Prior to this conversion the variables are defined as real
      process variables. Equation 64 depicts the previously stated point and defines the deviation
      variable.
      𝑦
      ′
      (𝑡) = 𝑦(𝑡) − 𝑦𝑠
      (0) (64)
      Where 𝑦′(𝑡) represents the deviation variable, 𝑦(𝑡) represents the variables actual value at
      time t and 𝑦𝑠
      (0) represents the steady state value at time 0. A transformation of variables into
      deviation variables is a necessity when converting from time domain to the Laplace domain.
      This greatly simplifies process control, with a deviation value of 0 desired as this shows that
      there is no deviation about the set-point.

      real variables.
      Figure 27 depicts the approximated system highlighting the deviation variables (magenta) and
      the real variables (blue). In Figure 28, Fa and Fs are the real measurable inputs with Tcy, T1
      and Trg the measurable outputs also considered to be real. The Laplace transfer function is used
      to link the input Fa to the output Tcy with deviation variables.
      Figure 28 – PID controller for real system; pink represents deviation variables and blue represents real
      variables.
      For the simulation of the FCCU, deviation forms of the regenerator air rate and regenerator gas
      cyclone temperature are formed as shown in Equations 65 and 66 respectively.

      ′ = 𝐹𝑎 − 𝐹𝑎𝑠 (65)
      𝑇𝑐𝑦
      ′ = 𝑇𝑐𝑦 − 𝑇𝑐𝑦𝑠 (66)
      The difference between the real and desired Tcy is calculated by the comparator, the result of
      which is called the error, also a deviation variable, and this is sent to the controller. Dependent
      upon the value received, the controller can make a decision of whether to manipulate the value
      of Fa. The constant initial value of Fa, set as 25.35 kg s-1, which is received by the comparator
      is a real value; however, the input from the controller is a deviation variable. The two values
      are summed together to produce a new Fa value, a real variable, which is then used to produce
      the desired output, also all real.

      TASK E
      CHOOSE YOUR TWO BEST CONTROLLERS. EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE THE BEST. FOR
      THE CLOSED-LOOP SIMULATION OF THE REAL SYSTEM WITH THESE BEST
      CONTROLLERS, PLOT THE INPUTS AS WELL AS TRG AS A FUNCTION OF TIME. DO
      YOU THINK THE VALUES OF THE INPUTS AND OF TRG ARE PHYSICAL/REALISTIC?
      IF THEY ARE NOT YOU NEED TO RETUNE YOUR CONTROLLERS SO THAT THEY
      PRODUCE REALISTIC OUTPUTS. CLEARLY JUSTIFY YOUR WORK AND ANSWERS.
      As aforementioned, the two best controllers designed during Task C, for a closed loop system,
      were the IMC Controllers with the delay approximated using the Taylor expansion and Pade
      methods. This was due to the Ziegler-Nicholas and Cohen-Coon PI and PID controllers both
      showing a large overshoot in their initial responses, as well as achieving steady state slower
      than the IMC controllers. In addition to this, when using a PID controller, the response was
      greatly affected by the filter coefficient – as the coefficient was increased, the wavelength and
      amplitude of the oscillations increased around the set-point, reducing system stability. This was
      not the case with the IMC controllers, with both showing little variation with increasing filter
      coefficient.
      For analysis of the IMC Controller with delay approximated by Taylor expansion, the step
      change chosen for this simulation was 20 K, occurring at a time of 10 seconds, setting an initial
      temperature of Tcy as 988.1 K with a final output of 1008.1 K, with both the IMC controllers
      with delays approximated by Taylor expansion and Pade modelled for their inputs; step change
      of Tcy, Fa and Fs, and outputs; Tcy and Trg. Further to this the error for each of the controllers
      was also modelled. The inputs and outputs to the system are shown in Figures 29 and 30, on
      different graphs, such that the y-axis is correctly scaled to read the results.
      Figure 29 – Inputs to the system using IMC (Taylor) with a step change from 998.1 K to 1008.1 K.
      Adam Bradford-Timlin: 9933571 Louis Brackenbury: 9931733
      32
      The step change in the output Tcy is from 998.1 to 1008.1, a 20 K increase. The output for Tcy
      in Figure 30 shows this, with a slight overshoot of approximately 1 K before achieving steady
      state after approximately 81 s. As the temperature of Tcy tends toward steady state after the step
      change, there is a decrease in the error, labelled in Figure 29. This is due to a slight increase
      in Fa (the hot air flowrate) ensuring that the temperature the regenerator can increase.
      Subsequently, this causes an increase in Trg, highlighted in Figure 30 – a larger increase
      occurring in Trg in comparison to Tcy.
      However, the increasing temperatures within the regenerator also cause an increase in the
      temperature in the reactor, as T1 increases from a value of 776.7 K prior to the step change to
      796.8 K after the step change; however, there is no effect to the input Fs, as it maintains a value
      of 294 kg s-1
      Figure 30 – Outputs to the system using IMC (Pade) with a step change from 998.1 K to 1008.1 K.
      Similarly, the analysis was conducted for the IMC controller with delay approximated by the
      Pade method. The same step change of 20 K was chosen, with the change occurring at 10 s to
      test the effect of changing Tcy on the other inputs and outputs. The results are shown in Figure
      31 for inputs and Figure 32 for outputs.
      The same trend as for the Taylor expansion PI controller is seen in this scenario, with all three
      outputs seeing an increase in temperature, after the 20 K step change in Tcy. The input Fa is
      increased to facilitate this increase in Tcy; however, the PID controller ensures there is an
      overshoot of hot air flowrate into the system, as depicted in Figure 31. This did not occur in
      the prior case, as instead there was an overshoot in the output Tcy. In addition to this, the time
      taken to reach steady state for Tcy after the step change is decreased for the PID controller to
      approximately 71 s – a quicker response using the Pade PID controller than the PI Taylor
      controller. Finally, similar to the previous case, there is an increase in the temperature T1, with
      no increase or decrease in the Fs input.

      Figure 32 - Outputs to the system using IMC (Pade) with a step change from 998.1 K to 1008.1 K.
      These results can be considered realistic for the two IMC controllers. In theory, in a FCCU the
      regenerator gas temperature is greater than the bed temperature. This is due to a temperature
      variation existing in the vertical section of the regenerator vessel. The highest and lowest values
      of these temperatures can be found at the flue gas line and the regenerator bed respectively.
      Therefore, Tcy is greater than or equal to Trg.
      TASK F
      FOR THE BEST TWO CONTROLLERS YOU HAVE DESIGNED YOU NEED TO FIND:
      I. WHAT IS THE RANGE OF SET-POINTS THAT YOUR CONTROLLER CAN BE TRUSTED,
      I.E. ALL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS REMAIN REALISTIC AND THE SET -POINT IS
      SATISFIED?

      The limiting set points of the controller are determined by the physical limitations of the
      system, in terms of equipment capacity, and flowrates not being able to attain negative values.
      For example, the IMC controllers are limited by the inability for the hot air flowrate to go
      below zero; and therefore, there will be a minimum achievable temperature that this controller
      can realise.
      In order to attain the maximum value for the IMC Controller with delay approximated by
      Taylor expansion, a step change from 988.1 K to 1500 K was induced at a time of 10 s (this
      value could be increased if the Tcy temperature was able to attain this set-point and achieve
      steady state). The result for this is described in Figure 33 and Figure 34 showing the inputs
      and outputs respectively.
      Figure 33 – Inputs to system using IMC (Taylor) with a step change from 988.1 K to 1500.0 K at a time of
      t=10s.
      As the temperature Tcy increases, to meet the new set-point, the input Fa increases, meaning a
      larger flow of hot air enters the regenerator to increase both Tcy and Trg. Despite the flowrate
      of hot air increasing beyond 1000 kg s-1, the temperature Tcy is maximised at a value of 1206
      K. Additionally, the temperature Trg also increases, surpassing Tcy and maximising at a value
      of 1363 K after approximately 300 s.

      Figure 34 - Outputs to system using IMC (Taylor) with a step change from 988.1 K to 1500.0 K at a time of
      t=10s.
      Equally, the minimum temperature for Tcy for this controller can be determined, through
      decreasing the set-point until Fa equates to 0 kg s-1. Any value beyond this will be negative
      flow and this is not physically possible, as aforementioned. The results of this study are shown
      in Figures 35 and 36 for both the inputs and outputs respectively.
      The set-point at which the flowrate of hot air equates to zero; and consequently, the minimum
      attainable temperature of Tcy is found to be 803.2 K. This is represented in Figure 35 for inputs
      and Figure 36 for outputs, with Figure 37 showing clearly that the value for input Fa does not
      reduce below 0.

      This analysis is conducted in the same manner for the IMC controller with delay approximated
      using the Pade method; and therefore, the minimum and maximum temperatures achieved were
      778.0 and 1206.0 K. This is similarly shown in Figures 38-41.

      YOUR CONTROLLER CAN REJECT, WHILE ALL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS REMAIN

      An initial test was set up to understand the effect of disturbances on the cyclone temperature,
      Tcy when set at a value of 988.1 K with no step change. The input used to create the disturbance
      was the ‘band limited white noise’ set for values of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 for both the PI
      (Taylor) and PID (Pade) controllers. It must be noted the PID controller was set with a filter
      coefficient value of 1. The results for this are shown in Figures 42-47.

      In summary, the results for increasing the noise power and the resulting effect on Tcy can be
      summarised by Table 8.
      Table 8 – Oscillations and deviation for Tcy from set point when varying the noise power.

      As the noise power increases, so did the amplitude of the oscillations around the set-point:
      however, despite seeing this increase in % deviation from the set-point, a noise power of 100
      only has a deviation of 0.25 % - a minimal value.
      In addition to this, the effect of increasing noise power can be examined for the output Fs. For
      a constant Fs at a set-point of 294 kg s-1, the results can be seen in Figures 48-53. It can be
      seen that as the noise power increases from a factor of 1 to a factor of 100, the oscillations
      increase from ± 11 kg s-1 to ± 121 kg s-1. Even considering these fluctuations, the values
      produced are still physically possible, with Fs all being a positive value. However; in reality
      operations exhibiting such fluctuations would not be feasible. A pump would not be able to
      sustain operation with such rapid deviations; a typical pump would alter the flow passing
      through it through the use of a VSD, requiring a large heat sink for excess energy, and as such
      the rapid deviations could lead to overheating and subsequent maintenance issues (Brumbach
      and Clade, 2017).

      The noise power was increased to the point at which the result is no longer physically feasible
      as the flowrate drops below zero. This is highlighted in Figure 54 for a noise power of 657.

      Figure 54 - Changing response of input Fs, for a set-point of 294 kg s-1, with noise factor of 657.
      Similar to the work previously done to Fs, a noise block was introduced to understand the effect
      of the disturbance of Fa, at a set-point value of 988.1 K. The flowsheet for this is described in
      Figure 55.

      When noise is introduced to the input Fa, the noise cannot be increased above 5, due to the
      input decreasing below a flowrate of 0. This result is shown in Figure 56, as well as showing
      the response for a noise power of 1 in Figure 57.

      Figure 57 - Changing response of input Fa, for a set-point of 25.35 kg s-1, with noise factor of 1.
      The resulting effect on the outputs Tcy and Trg for a noise factor of 5, at a set-point value for Fa
      of 25.35 kg s-1. This was conducted for both the PI and PID IMC controllers and is described
      in Figure 58.
